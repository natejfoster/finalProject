The purpose of our project is to expose our users to a variety of opinions so they have the information they need to become more aware of their biases and the diversity of the people around them. Many social media sites use the preferences and biases of a user to determine what information to display to that user. This limited exposure to ideas greatly skews people's perceptions of the world and their place in it. Our aim is to break down this social media ‘echo chamber.’ We want to create an application that lets people explicitly see their own opinions and how they compare to the opinions held by other people on Twitter. This increased awareness will hopefully cause users to evaluate their own opinions more critically and understand other people more deeply.

Add some information about articles and links to those articles...


Our project will enable users to break out of real and virtual communities that affirm particular narratives. The application will not filter information to the preferences of the users, but rather will give the user an accurate reflection of the diverse opinions held on Twitter. We hope that exposure to a wide range of ideas will help users to have more informed conversations about these issues and will give users the information they need to more critically evaluate their own opinions. As a result, we hope that users will have a deeper understanding of the people around them and an increased awareness of the diversity of the world.
