This website was our final project for our INFO 343 Client-Side Web Development class at the University of Washington. We were inspired by the recent election to create a project that broke down the social media ‘echo chamber.’ Our hope is that this project will enable users to break out of real and virtual communities that affirm particular narratives. We hope that exposure to a wide range of ideas will help users to have more informed conversations about these issues and will give users the information they need to critically evaluate their own opinions.
