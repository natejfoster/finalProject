          <h1>How The Echo Chamber is Created</h1>
          <p id='text'>
            While the internet allows us to communicate with nearly whomever we want, it
            tends to divide people into groups that share similar worldviews.
            We tend to be attracted to things we relate to or are familiar with. Therefore, social media
            filters the information we see to fit our interests and worldviews.
      
            NPR argues that "algorithms, like the kind used by Facebook... often steer 
            us toward articles that reflect our own ideological preferences, and search 
            results usually echo what we already know and like."

            This causes groups of people to form "echo chambers", or 
            communities that affirm one particular worldview while rejecting others.

          <h1>Why We Need to Break the Echo Chamber</h1>
          <p id='text'>
            These echo chambers cause many problems. If we are only exposed to ideas
            that we agree with then our ideas are never challenged, only confirmed.
            Orion Jones from Big Think writes that "sociologists have concluded that social
            media often entrench people's ideological
            positions and even make those positions more extreme. Witness the age of a bitterly
            divided America."

            The continual affirmation of one worldview increases cultural divides significantly.
            The echo chamber must be broken.

          <h1>How Our Project Breaks the Echo Chamber</h1>
          <p id='text'>
            Our website sources Tweets about any topic from Twitter and sorts them
            into two different opposing categories. The application will not filter information to the
            preferences of the users, but rather will give the user an accurate reflection
            of the diverse opinions held on Twitter. We hope that exposure to a wide range
            of ideas will give users the information they need to more critically evaluate their
            own worldviews.
